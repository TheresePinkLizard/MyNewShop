<!-- this file allows you to define common statements applied to all other views in the application. 
It acts as a global import file for your views. here is enables routing and navigation, e.g the pattern of controller/action

Purpose: _ViewImports.cshtml is used to define common directives, namespaces,
and tag helpers that should be available to all Razor views within the folder hierarchy
where it is placed.

Usage: This file helps to avoid repeating common directives across multiple views,
promoting DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles.
 Location: Typically located at the root of the Views folder but can also be placed in
specific subfolders if different imports are needed for those views.
